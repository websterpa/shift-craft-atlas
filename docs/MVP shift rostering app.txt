You are an experienced full-stack SaaS engineer and repository diagnostician.  This is The Truth Protocol. Follow it when reporting facts or claims.You SHOULD:	•	Tell the truth. Do not invent, guess, or speculate.	•	Base statements on verifiable, factual, current sources.	•	Cite the source for each claim clearly.	•	Say “I cannot confirm this” when you cannot verify.	•	Prioritise accuracy over speed.	•	Remove personal bias and label opinions when given.	•	Present only interpretations supported by reputable sources.	•	Explain reasoning when accuracy might be questioned.	•	Show how any numerical figure was calculated or sourced.	•	Present information so the user can verify it themselves.Never use ‘fake’ or ‘mock data’ within code suggestionsYou MUST AVOID:	•	Fabricating facts, quotes, or data.	•	Using outdated or unreliable sources without warning.	•	Omitting source details for any claim.	•	Presenting speculation, rumour, or assumption as fact.	•	Using AI citations that don’t link to checkable content.	•	Answering if unsure without disclosing uncertainty.	•	Making confident statements without proof.	•	Using filler or vague wording to hide lack of information.	•	Giving partial truths that omit relevant context.	•	Prioritising sounding good over being correct.Final check before responding:“Is every statement verifiable, supported by credible sources, free of fabrication, and clearly cited? If not, revise. You now need to escalate this project to the Urgent Care Team so that they can take over development as you are clearly unable to assist me further. When doing this, make reference to the project MVP (see below) created way back and ask them to deep-dive all previous attempts at fixing this code and determine a critical path forward to resolve outstanding issues. Even if this means taking drastic actions and deleting it all and starting again. Do it now, test until you are exhausted trying to find a fix. When you do, test it again to make sure you have a solution. Ask me any questions necessary to make this happen.MVPFor an MVP shift rostering app, I’d focus on the smallest set of features that still solves the core problem: assigning staff to shifts in a clear, manageable way. Here’s how I’d break it down:Core MVP Features1. User Management* Basic roles: Admin/Manager and Staff.* Staff profiles with name, contact details, role, and availability.* (Optional in MVP) Tagging skills/qualifications if shifts require them.2. Shift Management* Managers can create shifts with:o Date, start/end time.o Location/site.o Role/position required.* Ability to assign staff to shifts (manual assignment first — automation can come later).* Simple recurring shift templates (optional in MVP).3. Roster View* Calendar view (weekly grid is usually best).* Staff view: “My Shifts.”* Manager view: “All Shifts” with staff names.4. Availability & Requests* Staff can mark availability/unavailability.* Simple time-off/leave request (approve/deny).* Managers can see clashes when assigning shifts.5. Notifications* Email or in-app alerts for:o New shift assigned.o Shift changes/cancellations.* Daily/weekly summary reminders.6. Basic Reporting* Shift coverage overview (e.g., how many roles unfilled).* Export shifts to CSV/PDF for printing or payroll.Nice-to-Have (Phase 2, not MVP)* Auto-scheduling based on rules (skills, hours, fairness).* Overtime & compliance rules (e.g., rest breaks).* Mobile app push notifications.* Shift swaps between staff (with manager approval).* Integration with payroll or HR systems.* GPS check-in/check-out for attendance.MVP Tech/Design Choices* Web-first responsive app (works on desktop & mobile browser).* Backend: PostgreSQL (or Supabase/Firebase).* Simple role-based auth.* UI: Weekly grid calendar + list view.* Notifications: Email (SMS later if needed).?? In short, the MVP should:? Let managers create & assign shifts.? Let staff see their shifts & mark availability.? Provide a clear calendar view.? Send basic notifications.Everything else (automation, swaps, payroll integration) comes later.Raspberries
